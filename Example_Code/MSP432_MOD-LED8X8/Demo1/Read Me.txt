	*** OLIMEX demo project for the MOD-LED8X8R ***

1. Requirements
	- LaunchPad MSP-EXP430G2 by Texas Instruments
	- MSP430-LED-BOOSTERPACK demo board by Olimex
	- One or more MOD-LED8X8R matrix by Olimex
	- IAR for MSP 5.10 IDE  (or newer version) by IAR
	- miniUSB cable connected to a PC

2. Description
	The demo demonstrates the functionality of the various of features including:
	- Serial Peripheral Interface
	- Button
	- LED matrix
	- Timer A
	- Interrupts
	
	Upon power up the user is presented the first few symbols of the welcome message ("www.olimex.com/dev " by default).
	By pressing the button (P1.3) you will slide the text left or right depending on the defined macros (left by default).
	In order to affect the board you can change some of the settings by modifying the following macros placed in "main.h" header file:
	TEXT 			-	This is the displayed message. You can put here any valid string with max length 835 symblos.
	SLIDE_DIRECTION	-	Direction of the message sliding. Possible values: Right (0); Left (1).
	MATRIX_COUNT 	-	Select the number of the connected matrices.
	PERIOD			-	Time interval of interruption entry. For more matrices it's important this period to be higher (to avoid
						permanent interruptions) because the interrupt requires more time to complete his tasks.
	DELAY_TIME		-	Simple delay time to decrease speed of sliding. It's all your choice to select this value.
	
	For 1-4 LED matrices (MATRIX_COUNT) there are default values of the macros PERIOD and DELAY_TIME which of course can be modified.
	For another value of MATRIX_COUNT you should select the proper value of the macros PERIOD and DELAY_TIME.
	
3. How to use this demo
	Open "\MOD-LED8X8\Demo\MOD-LED_8X8.eww", make/build project and program the board.
	Project Options:
	General Options - Device: MSP430G2231
